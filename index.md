# Welcome to Hacking and Humanities!

Academia is in crisis, and the possibilities for fulfilling, stable, employment in the field are rapidly shrinking for those that are not on the tenure track. 

I was a postdoc for 2 years, and then a Visiting Assistant Professor for another 2. Over this time, I became interested in the field of cybersecurity, initially because I was interested in protecting the data of my research subjects, and then over time became more and more interested in the topic for its own sake. This interest became a hobby, and then, when I realized I no longer wanted to uproot my life one more time to chase down a tenure-track position, began to seriously study in order to transition into the field. I now work in IT at a Fortune 500 company, in a city that I love and have wanted to live in for years.

It has been a difficult journey, but ultimately rewarding, and in cybersecurity I have found joy, an intellectual community that is wholesome, diverse, supportive, and engaged. I have also found that my skills in research and rigorous thought, as well as the creativity and self-discipline that academia has fostered have translated extremely well into this field. I want to help others in academia that have been affected by casualization, and want a different life along their journey in this field.

## The Program

If you are a non-tenure-track professor or graduate student in the humanities, and frustrated by casualization and need a change, contact me at hackingandhumanities@gmail.com. Over the course of a year, I will mentor you in training for a new career in infosec/cybersecurity/ethical hacking, culminating in you taking either the OSCP course or the eCPPT certification course, which will qualify you for employment in the field.

This mentorship will include:

1. Access to me to answer questions via email, Signal, and video chat.
2. A clear, self-paced syllabus that solely assumes on day one that you know how to turn on a computer, browse the web, and do email, and takes you to an employable level of competency in ethical hacking.
3. Membership in a Slack channel with other people going through the same experience as you.
4. Mentoring on the industry, applying for jobs, converting your CV to a resume, and how to market yourself in a seller's market.

This offer is limited to non-tenure-track professors and graduate students in humanities (broadly defined), and requires a subscription fee of 75$ a month. If you want to work in either Florida or Atlanta, I will be also able to put you in touch with recruiters in the field that will help you get a job rapidly, and if hired through them I will also be able to reimburse you $500 of your subscription fees to me.
