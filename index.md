# Welcome to Hacking and Humanities!

Academia is in crisis, and the possibilities for fulfilling, stable, employment in the field are rapidly shrinking for those that are not on the tenure track. 

I was a postdoc for 2 years, and then a Visiting Assistant Professor for another 2. Over this time, I became interested in the field of cybersecurity, initially because I was interested in protecting the data of my research subjects, and then over time became more and more interested in the topic for its own sake. This interest became a hobby, and then, when I realized I no longer wanted to uproot my life one more time to chase down a tenure-track position, began to seriously study in order to transition into the field. I now work in IT at a Fortune 500 company, in a city that I love and have wanted to live in for years.
